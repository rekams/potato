        <h2> The History of the Potato</h2>
         <img src="./South American potatoes.jpg" class="imagerecipie2" alt="Various potatoes from South America">
        <h3>Origins:</h3>
          <p>
              It is thought that potatoes have been around for a long time: 
              the earliest archaeologically verified potato tuber is from the 
              coastal site of Ancon in mordern day central Peru dating from
              2500 BC.
              However, we think the Incans have been cultivating them from 8000 BC.
          </p>
        <h3>Introduction to Europe:</h3>
          <p>
             After the Spanish invaded South America they started to 
             bring materials, such as poatoes, back to Europe. It is 
             thought that the Potato entered Europe as early as 1536. 
             It is not known exactly when Potatoes came to Ireland and 
             there is some debate as to how they came to Ireland. Some say 
             floated into Cork from the wreckage of the Armada while others 
             claim it is from Sir Walter Raleigh planting them at his Cork 
             estate in 1589.

          </p>
        <h3>The Potato Famine:</h3>
          <p>
              Between 1845 and 1849 a disease called Late Blight caused
              the Potato Crop to fail in Ireland. Leading to the death of about one 
              million people from starvation and the emmigration of around two-and-a-half
              million people to America.
          </p>
        <h3>Today:</h3>
        <p>
            Today Potatoes are the worlds fourth largest food crop 
            (after maize, wheat and rice). Over three thousand varities 
            of cultivated potato can be found as well as over two hundred 
            species of wild potato. They come in russet, red, white, yellow 
            and purple.
