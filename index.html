      This website is dedicated to our shared love of potatoes. Be they large or small, lumpy or smooth, brown, 
      red or purple, potatoes bring joy and nutrition in our lives. With this website we are hoping to give a tribute
      to potatoes, raise awareness about their greatness and give people ideas about how to best prepare them. In line
      with this, we have a section on the History of Potatoes, an ever expanding list of Potato Recipes and a list of 
      Potato Fun Facts. Please have a look around the site, expand your potato knowledge and have some fun!
